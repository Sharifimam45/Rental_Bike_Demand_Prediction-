# Rental_Bike_Demand_Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict daily bike rental counts based on historical weather and seasonal data from Washington D.C.‚Äôs Capital Bikeshare system (2011‚Äì2012).

##  Dataset

The dataset used is [`day.csv`](day.csv), part of the Bike Sharing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Features Used

- Season, Month, Weekday
- Holiday and Working Day indicators
- Weather situation
- Temperature, Atemp (feels-like temperature), Humidity, Windspeed

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Model

We used a **Random Forest Regressor** to train the model on the dataset and evaluated using:
- R¬≤ Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


##  Improvements

- Model tuning using GridSearchCV
- Try other models: XGBoost, LightGBM
- Deployment using Streamlit or Flask
